# QuickHull
 
This Java code generates a set of random points, calculates their convex hull using a simple QuickHull algorithm, and then visualizes the points and their convex hull using the DUDraw library. The convex hull is the smallest polygon that encloses all the points. The points are drawn in black and the convex hull is drawn in green. The code also prints the coordinates of the generated points.
